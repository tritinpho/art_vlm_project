## 🔧 API Reference

### POST /analyze
Analyze an artwork image with three modes:

**Request Format:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze" \
  -F "image=@artwork.jpg" \
  -F "analysis_mode=Stylometry & Forgery Detection" \
  -F "question=Who is the artist?"  # Optional for VQA
```

**Analysis Modes:**
- `Stylometry & Forgery Detection`: Artist identification and authenticity analysis
- `Art Historical VQA`: Answer questions about the artwork
- `Expert-Level Captioning`: Generate detailed art historical descriptions

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "mode": "stylometry",
  "artist": "Leonardo da Vinci",
  "style": "High Renaissance",
  "period": "Late 15th Century",
  "authenticity_score": 0.95,
  "is_outlier": false,
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Web Interface Usage

1. **Configure API Endpoint**
   - Enter your ArtVLM API URL (default: `http://localhost:8000`)
   - Test the connection using the "Test API Connection" button

2. **Upload an Image**
   - Click "Browse files" to upload an artwork image
   - Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG
   - Recommended file size: < 10MB

3. **Select Analysis Mode**
   - **Stylometry & Forgery Detection**: For artist identification and authenticity
   - **Art Historical VQA**: For specific questions about the artwork
   - **Expert-Level Captioning**: For comprehensive art historical analysis

4. **Analyze and Review Results**
   - Click "Analyze Artwork" to process the image
   - View detailed results with confidence scores
   - Access debug information if needed

5. **Provide Feedback** (Optional)
   - Rate the response quality (1-5 scale):
     - **Fluency**: Grammatical correctness and natural language
     - **Relevance & Accuracy**: Factual correctness
     - **Descriptiveness & Insight**: Depth of analysis
   - Add qualitative comments for improvement

### Example Workflow

**Question**: "What year was this art created?"

**Response**: "This artwork, 'The Last Supper' by Leonardo da Vinci, was created between 1495 and 1498. It was painted as a fresco on the wall of the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy."
